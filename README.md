# PythonLesson
因为之前用来放练习代码的仓库，文件结构混乱。 于是，今天再开一个仓库，存放所学，所用过的python代码
*The file structure is confusing because of the warehouse that was used to store the exercise code wasn't ogrized well . So,I open another warehouse today to store the Python code that I've learned and used*
* I hope someone can come to point out mistakes .  Any advice will be welcome!
